# How to Handle Distributed Transaction effectively using DomainDrivenModel ,EventDrivenArchitecture applying CQRS & SAGA Design Patterns.

What we See 

### SetBased Consistency Validation : In simple words when you have decoupled your architecture using CQRS design pattern.
#### The major problem we see is StateValidation, As the data gets persisted first on the ReadDatabase and then the communication happens 
through Eventbus which can lead to Inconsistent State, Validating the aggregated state is even a time consuming process.
To avoid this problem better to implement Lookup Commmand Database at the command side.
